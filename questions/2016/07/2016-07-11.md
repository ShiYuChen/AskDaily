question: What's the process of html's parsing by browser?
tags: Web, Browser

## Example

A html like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Test</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style1.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style2.css" media="print">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Content.... -->
  <img src="image.png" alt="Image">
  <script type="text/javascript" src="script1.js" async></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="script2.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

1. Browser parses the html file, and begins to construct the DOM tree.
    1. Meet **style1.css**: Download this file, keep constructing the DOM tree.
    2. Meet **style2.css**: Download this file, keep constructing the DOM tree.
    3. Meet **image.png**: Download this file, keep constructing the DOM tree.
    4. Meet **script1.js**: Download this file, keep constructing the DOM tree.
    5. Meet **script2.js**: Download this file, stop DOM tree's construction.
    6. All files' downloading will be parallel (within the limit of browser).
2. After **script2.js** downloaded, browser begins to execute it once the **style1.css** has been downloaded and its CSSOM has been built.
3. Once **script2.js** has been executed completely, browsers continue constructing DOM tree.
4. After browser finished parse the html file, triggers the `DOMContentedLoaded` event.
5. Begin to render the page with DOM tree and **style1.css**'s CSSOM.
6. Once **style2.css** downloaded, browser parses it.
7. Once **script1.js** downloaded, if DOM is under construction, then stop DOM and excute the script; if `DOMContentLoaded`, then just excute it...
8. Once **image.png**, **style1.css** and **script1.js** has been downloaded and processed, browser triggers the `load` event.

### Why

1. **style1.css** and **script2.js** won't influence the DOM and the render process.
    * `media='print'` means it will be used only at *printing*.
    * `async` means it does not process the DOM at all
2. Scripts (not async) will block the DOM tree's construction.
3. Scripts's excution must wait until all essential css have been parsed. Notice that DOM has been stopped while css's parsing.
4. Once DOM tree has been constructed, trigger the `DOMContentedLoaded` event.
5. Once all resources has been loaded, trigger the `load` event.

## Main Flow

1. Parsing HTML to construct the DOM tree.
2. Render tree construction.
3. Layout of the render tree.
4. Painting the render tree.
